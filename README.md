# RestTest
Finds details of a mac address.

The details of the given Mac address are fetched from macaddress.io
The given mac address is validated before sending the API request.
API connection does not use requests/urllib/http.client packages of python.
The API call is handled in a more rudimentary socket ssl programming way.
Socket connection is established with the host over the https port 443, and response is parsed to extract the Json.
The Hostname and API key required to access the details are stored in a separate config file, for security and easy management.

Input: Mac Address.

example:
Please enter the macAddress:
44:38:39:ff:ef:57

Output: Company name and details.

example:

Company Details:

<Address>


Though only company details are shown as output, All the details returned by the API are stored as a json file for future use.
The program also generates a log file, Log levels for the same can be set easily.
